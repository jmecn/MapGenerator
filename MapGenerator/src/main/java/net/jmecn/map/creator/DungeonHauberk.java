/// The random dungeon generator.
///
/// Starting with a stage of solid walls, it works like so:
///
/// 1. Place a number of randomly sized and positioned rooms. If a room
///    overlaps an existing room, it is discarded. Any remaining rooms are
///    carved out.
/// 2. Any remaining solid areas are filled in with mazes. The maze generator
///    will grow and fill in even odd-shaped areas, but will not touch any
///    rooms.
/// 3. The result of the previous two steps is a series of unconnected rooms
///    and mazes. We walk the stage and find every tile that can be a
///    "connector". This is a solid tile that is adjacent to two unconnected
///    regions.
/// 4. We randomly choose connectors and open them or place a door there until
///    all of the unconnected regions have been joined. There is also a slight
///    chance to carve a connector between two already-joined regions, so that
///    the dungeon isn't single connected.
/// 5. The mazes will have a lot of dead ends. Finally, we remove those by
///    repeatedly filling in any open tile that's closed on three sides. When
///    this is done, every corridor in a maze actually leads somewhere.
///
/// The end result of this is a multiply-connected dungeon with rooms and lots
/// of winding corridors.
