/// The random dungeon generator.
///
/// Starting with a stage of solid walls, it works like so:
///
/// 1. Place a number of randomly sized and positioned rooms. If a room
///    overlaps an existing room, it is discarded. Any remaining rooms are
///    carved out.
/// 2. Any remaining solid areas are filled in with mazes. The maze generator
///    will grow and fill in even odd-shaped areas, but will not touch any
///    rooms.
/// 3. The result of the previous two steps is a series of unconnected rooms
///    and mazes. We walk the stage and find every tile that can be a
///    "connector". This is a solid tile that is adjacent to two unconnected
///    regions.
/// 4. We randomly choose connectors and open them or place a door there until
///    all of the unconnected regions have been joined. There is also a slight
///    chance to carve a connector between two already-joined regions, so that
///    the dungeon isn't single connected. <NOTICE: This is spanning tree!>
/// 5. The mazes will have a lot of dead ends. Finally, we remove those by
///    repeatedly filling in any open tile that's closed on three sides. When
///    this is done, every corridor in a maze actually leads somewhere.
///
/// The end result of this is a multiply-connected dungeon with rooms and lots
/// of winding corridors.

	/**
	 * Implementation of the "growing tree" algorithm from here:
	 * http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm.
	 * 
	 * This is a general algorithm, capable of creating Mazes of different
	 * textures. It requires storage up to the size of the Maze. Each time you
	 * carve a cell, add that cell to a list. Proceed by picking a cell from the
	 * list, and carving into an unmade cell next to it. If there are no unmade
	 * cells next to the current cell, remove the current cell from the list.
	 * The Maze is done when the list becomes empty. The interesting part that
	 * allows many possible textures is how you pick a cell from the list. For
	 * example, if you always pick the most recent cell added to it, this
	 * algorithm turns into the recursive backtracker. If you always pick cells
	 * at random, this will behave similarly but not exactly to Prim's
	 * algorithm. If you always pick the oldest cells added to the list, this
	 * will create Mazes with about as low a "river" factor as possible, even
	 * lower than Prim's algorithm. If you usually pick the most recent cell,
	 * but occasionally pick a random cell, the Maze will have a high "river"
	 * factor but a short direct solution. If you randomly pick among the most
	 * recent cells, the Maze will have a low "river" factor but a long windy
	 * solution.
